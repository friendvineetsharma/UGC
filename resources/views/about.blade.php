			<p class="sample-text"><strong>
				To match global standards of high quality research, in all academic disciplines under its purview, the University Grants Commission (UGC) aspires to stimulate and empower the Indian academia through its “Quality Mandate”.
         A public notice was issued by the UGC, on the 28th of November, 2018, to announce the establishment of a dedicated Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics (CARE) to carry out this mandate.
      </strong></p>
      <h3 class="text-heading">Objectives of the UGC</h3>
      <p class="sample-text">
				<ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>To promote quality research, academic integrity and publication ethics in Indian universities.</li>
          <li>To promote high quality publications in reputed journals that would help in achieving higher global ranks.</li>
          <li>To develop an approach and methodology for identification of good quality journals.</li>
          <li>To prevent publications in predatory/ dubious / sub-standard journals, which reflect adversely and tarnish the image of Indian academia.</li>
          <li>To create and maintain a “UGC Reference List of Quality Journals” (UGC List) for all academic purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-heading">Need for UGC List</h3>
      <p class="sample-text">
				<ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>The credibility of research publications is extremely important because it represents the academic image of not just an individual, but of the institution and the entire nation..</li>
          <li>The number of research articles published in reputed journals is one of the globally-accepted indicators considered for various academic purposes such as institutional ranking, appointments, promotions of faculty members, membership of academic committees, award of research degrees etc.</li>
          <li>The problem of predatory / dubious / sub-standard journals has become a cause of serious concern all over the world.</li>
          <li>The percentage of research articles published in poor quality journals is reported to be high in India, which has adversely affected its image.</li>
          <li>Publications in dubious / sub-standard journals reflect adversely leading to long-term academic damage and a tarnished image of an individual, institution and the nation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-heading">The Scope of the UGC List</h3>
      <p class="sample-text">
				<ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>UGC has taken the responsibility of preparing the “UGC-CARE Reference List of Quality Journals” (UGC List).</li>
          <li>A list of Indian journals, especially from disciplines of Arts, Humanities, Languages, Culture and Indian Knowledge Systems is being prepared and updated quarterly</li>
          <li>The UGC-CARE List includes journals from all disciplines indexed in globally accepted databases, such as indexed in Scopus (Source list) or Web of Science (Arts and Humanities Citation Index Source Publication, Science Citation Index Expanded Source Publication, Social Science Citation Index Source Publication). These journals are to be considered for all academic purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-heading">Updation of UGC List</h3>
      <p class="sample-text">
        The UGC-CARE List is dynamic. It shall be updated quarterly i.e. on the first of January, April, July, and October (or on the next working day if there is a public holiday on these dates) every year.
        <br><br>
        <i><strong>Note: </strong>If any good quality journal is missing, it may be submitted by following the prescribed submission process. If any undeserved journal is found anywhere in the List, it may kindly be reported through the <a href="/feedback">feedback option</a> available on the UGC website.</i>
